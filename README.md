# App

This is currently a small Rails App that uses [my gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/nba_api_wrapper), mostly for funsies while I play around with Angular on Rails

## Some Things I Plan To Try Out Here

* Rails as an API Server
* How well to Angular play with Rails
  * So things like redirecting non-index endpoints...
  * ...to templating on the client side vs server side
* Compiling my Angular Directives
* My gem!

## Some things that are probably not great

* The styling, this is primarily an exercise is server-client side interaction with in-development gems, rails servers, and angular. Sadly, that will mean an app that is not so very pretty. Maybe when I have time I'll come back to it. But really, the NBA's own site is pretty nice so if you really want to see all the data I suggest checking [theirs](http://stats.nba.com/) out!
